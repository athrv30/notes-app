Create Notes App
-Firstly, build the basic structure of the app using HTML, using different tags like <div>,<p>,<button> according to the requirement.
-Then, give the styling to the app using CSS, add properties like flex, position, and padding to beautify your app project, and give proper formatting, height, width, and color.
-Now it's time to give functionality to the add note, delete button, and save button. 
-Also, we have to store the notes in the localStorage to save them.
-For Add and Save we have independent functions.
